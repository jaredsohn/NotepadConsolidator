If you want to reuse this code, do whatever you want with it but give me credit.

Use this program to gather up the text of all open untitled instances of notepad.exe and consolidate them into one file.
Really useful if you have the annoying habit of using Windows (insert joke here) and going Start->Run->notepad whenever you want to record an idea that pops into your head.

Warning: You will lose data if any untitled notepad file is over MaxFileSize (1 MB), although I would expect this would be a rare occurrence; it doesn't affect me in my usage.

Future enhancement ideas:

* have an option to send an e-mail or scp instead (useful when running on other peoples' computers.)
